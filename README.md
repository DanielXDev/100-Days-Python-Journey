  #100 Days of Python: Learning & Building Journey ðŸš€
  Welcome to my 100 Days of Python journey! This repository documents my daily progress as I learn, practice, and build projects using Python. The goal is to develop a solid foundation in Python programming.
  
  âœ… Core Python concepts & best practices
  âœ… Algorithms & data structures
  âœ… Automation & scripting
  âœ… Web development with Flask/Django
  âœ… Data science & visualization
  âœ… Machine learning & AI basics
  
  **ðŸ“Œ Learning Path **
  
  ðŸ”¹ Days 1-14 â†’ Beginner Level (Fundamentals, syntax, data types, loops, functions, etc.)
  
  -Variables, Data Types & Manipulation â†’ Understanding variables, primitive data types, type conversion, and string manipulation.
  
  -Control Flow & Logical Operators â†’ Implementing if, elif, and else statements, comparison operators, and logical operators.
  
  -Randomization & Python Lists â†’ Using the random module, working with lists, indexing, and list methods.
  
  -Loops, Functions & Karel â†’ Implementing for and while loops, writing functions, and an intro to Karel (Python for beginners).
  
  -Function Parameters â†’ Understanding function arguments, keyword arguments, and default parameters.
   
  -Dictionaries & Nesting â†’ Creating and manipulating dictionaries, nesting lists and dictionaries for structured data.
  
  -Returning Function Outputs â†’ Understanding return statements, function outputs, and using return values in programs.
  
  -Local & Global Scope â†’ Exploring variable scope, global and local variables, and best practices.
