📡 Internet Speed Twitter Bot: A Detailed Breakdown
This script is an automated bot that:
✅ Measures your internet speed using Speedtest.net
✅ Generates a tweet based on whether the speed is good or bad
✅ Logs into Twitter (X) and automatically posts the tweet
✅ Handles pop-ups, errors, and login issues gracefully

💻 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ Setting Up the Environment
-The script loads credentials (Twitter email & password) from a .env file using dotenv.
-logging is configured to track events and errors.
-The script uses Selenium WebDriver (installed via webdriver_manager) to control a web browser for automation.

2️⃣ Running the Internet Speed Test
-The script opens the Speedtest.net website and clicks the "Start" button.
-It waits for the test to complete (~60 seconds).
-Once the test is done, it extracts the download and upload speeds from the webpage.
-If no valid speed is found (e.g., due to an error), it logs an error and skips posting a tweet.

3️⃣ Generating a Tweet Based on Speed Test Results
-If both download (≥50 Mbps) and upload (≥20 Mbps) speeds are fast, it picks a random tweet from a list of good speed messages.
-If the speeds are slow, it picks a random tweet from bad speed messages.
-The final tweet includes:
📅 Date & Time of the test
🔽 Download Speed
🔼 Upload Speed
A funny complaint or appreciation
Hashtags: #InternetStruggles #SpeedTest

4️⃣ Logging into Twitter (X) & Posting the Tweet
-Opens Twitter's login page and enters the email.
-Clicks “Next” and enters the password.
-Logs into the account and navigates to the tweet composer.
-Copies the tweet to clipboard (using pyperclip) and pastes it in the tweet box.
-Posts the tweet using Selenium’s execute_script to ensure the button click works.
-If anything fails, it logs the error and quits the browser gracefully.
