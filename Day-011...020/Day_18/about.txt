Project Summary: Hirst Painting Dot Art Generator ðŸŽ¨
This project is a Python-based digital painting program that recreates the Hirst dot painting style using the Turtle graphics library. It generates a grid of randomly colored dots, simulating the iconic abstract artwork style.

Key Features:
âœ… Turtle Graphics Implementation â†’ Uses the turtle module to draw dots dynamically.
âœ… Randomized Color Selection â†’ Selects colors from a predefined palette for variety.
âœ… Efficient Grid Drawing â†’ Automates dot placement using loops and coordinate adjustments.
âœ… Speed Optimization â†’ Implements speed("fastest") to ensure smooth rendering.
âœ… Interactive Display â†’ Keeps the drawing open until the user clicks to exit.

This project demonstrates looping, coordinate manipulation, functions, and Turtle graphics.
