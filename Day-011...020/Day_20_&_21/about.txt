Project Summary: Classic Snake Game 🐍
This project is a Python-based Snake Game built using the Turtle graphics library. It follows the classic arcade-style gameplay where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food, with the objective of achieving the highest score without colliding with walls or itself.

Key Features:
✅ OOP-Based Game Design → Uses Snake, Food, and Score classes for modularity.
✅ Keyboard Controls → Arrow key inputs allow movement in four directions.
✅ Food Collision Detection → The snake eats food, extends its length, and increases the score.
✅ Wall Collision Handling → The game resets when the snake hits the wall.
✅ Self-Collision Detection → The snake resets upon colliding with its own body.
✅ Score Management → Tracks and displays the current and highest score.

This project showcases OOP principles, event-driven programming, and game logic implementation.
