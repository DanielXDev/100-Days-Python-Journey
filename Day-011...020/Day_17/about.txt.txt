Project Summary: OOP-Based Quiz Game ðŸŽ¯
This project is a console-based quiz application that uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure and manage a series of quiz questions. The game tests the user's knowledge by presenting questions one by one while tracking their score.

Key Features:
âœ… Custom Question Class â†’ Encapsulates question text and answer storage.
âœ… Quiz Engine (QuizBrain) â†’ Handles question flow, user input, and scorekeeping.
âœ… Dynamic Question Bank â†’ Populates questions from an external data source (question_data).
âœ… User Interaction â†’ Asks questions sequentially and validates user responses.
âœ… Game Completion Message â†’ Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.

This project effectively demonstrates OOP principles, such as class design, instance creation, data encapsulation, and method execution.
