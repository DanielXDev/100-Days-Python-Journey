Automated Birthday Email Sender ðŸŽ‰
This script automatically sends personalized birthday emails based on data from birthdays.csv.

How It Works:
âœ… Reads Birthdays â†’ Extracts names & emails from birthdays.csv.
âœ… Checks Today's Date â†’ Matches birthdays with the current date.
âœ… Chooses a Random Letter â†’ Picks from 3 templates in letter_templates/.
âœ… Personalizes the Letter â†’ Replaces [NAME] with the recipientâ€™s name.
âœ… Sends an Email â†’ Uses SMTP with Gmail credentials from .env file.


This is a great project for learning automation, file handling, and SMTP email integration! ðŸš€
