Coding Activity Tracker with Pixela
This script automates the tracking of coding hours using the Pixela API, which allows users to create and update visual graphs for their daily progress.

How It Works:
1Ô∏è‚É£ User Registration (if not already registered):
Defines a user profile on Pixela with a username and API token.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Creation (if not already created):
Generates a graph named "Coding Graph" to track daily coding hours.
Uses hours as the unit and momiji (red) as the color.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Daily Pixel Update:
Retrieves the current date and logs 18 hours of coding for that day.
Sends a PUT request to update the graph with the new data.

üîπ Impact: Provides a visual representation of coding consistency, helping developers stay motivated and track progress effortlessly.
