Weather Alert System with OpenWeather and Twilio
This Python script fetches weather forecast data from OpenWeather's API and checks for rain within the next four forecasted time slots. If precipitation is detected (weather ID < 700), it sends an SMS alert via Twilio, advising the user to carry an umbrella. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating clear weather.

Key Features:
✅ Uses environment variables for API security.
✅ Sends SMS notifications via Twilio.
✅ Fetches short-term weather forecasts (next few hours).
