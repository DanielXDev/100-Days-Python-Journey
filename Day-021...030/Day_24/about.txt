Project Summary: Automated Invitation Letter Generator 📜✉️
This project is a Python-based automation tool that generates personalized invitation letters by replacing placeholders with actual names from a list.

Key Features:
✅ File Handling → Reads names from invited_names.txt and a template from starting_letter.txt.
✅ Placeholder Replacement → Dynamically replaces [name] with each invitee’s actual name.
✅ Automated Letter Generation → Saves personalized letters as .docx files in the ReadyToSend folder.
✅ Looping & String Manipulation → Iterates through all names and formats each letter correctly.

This project demonstrates file I/O, string manipulation, and automation techniques. Future improvements could include email integration, PDF export, or bulk message scheduling. 🚀
