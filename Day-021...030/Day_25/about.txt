Project Summary: U.S. States Guessing Game📍
This project is a Python-based geography quiz that challenges users to name all 50 U.S. states. Using turtle graphics and pandas, it provides an interactive and educational experience.

Key Features:
✅ Graphical Map Interface → Displays a U.S. map using turtle graphics.
✅ User Input & Validation → Players type state names; correct guesses appear on the map.
✅ Score Tracking → Displays the number of correctly guessed states.
✅ Case-Insensitive Matching → Allows input in any capitalization format.
✅ Progress Saving → If the player quits, unguessed states are saved in states_to_learn.csv.

This project demonstrates event-driven programming, GUI handling with turtle, and data manipulation with pandas. Future improvements could include timed challenges, hints, or multiple difficulty levels. 🚀
