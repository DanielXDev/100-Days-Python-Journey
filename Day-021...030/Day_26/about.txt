Project Summary: NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter ðŸ”¤ðŸ“–
This Python project converts user-inputted names into their NATO phonetic alphabet equivalent. It uses pandas for handling the phonetic alphabet dataset and dictionary comprehensions for fast lookups.

Key Features:
âœ… CSV Data Handling â†’ Reads NATO phonetic alphabet data using pandas.
âœ… Dictionary Comprehension â†’ Maps letters to phonetic codes efficiently.
âœ… User Input Handling â†’ Accepts a name and converts each letter to its phonetic code.
âœ… Error Handling â†’ Ensures only alphabetic characters are processed.
âœ… Recursive Prompting â†’ If an invalid character is entered, the user is prompted again.

This project is a great beginner-friendly exercise in data handling, dictionary comprehension, and user interaction. Future improvements could include support for full sentences, GUI integration, or audio pronunciation playback. ðŸš€
